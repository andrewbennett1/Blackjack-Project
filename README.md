Blackjack Project by Andrew Bennett

Unfortunately, I have had some issues implementing multiplayer which I was unable to fix. Most of the server stuff works, it just does not work as intended. Singleplayer works as expected. To use multiplayer or change game settings, go to the rules.py file.

The current state of multiplayer took ages though, and all screen elemenets can be resizes also which took some time. Thats my compensation for not having betting.
